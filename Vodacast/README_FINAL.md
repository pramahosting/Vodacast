## 🚨 Important Notes

### Ethical Usage
- ⚠️ **Use responsibly and ethically**
- ✅ Always obtain consent before using someone's likeness
- ✅ Clearly label AI-generated content
- ✅ Comply with local laws and regulations

### Performance Considerations
- Basic audio features work on any modern computer
- Video processing requires more computational power
- GPU acceleration recommended for real-time processing
- Internet connection required for gTTS

### Security
- API keys should be kept secure
- Use environment variables for production
- Be aware of data privacy when using external APIs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check if virtual environment is activated
source vodacast_env/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --upgrade streamlit gtts requests

# Try different port
streamlit run vodacast_enhanced.py --server.port 8502
```

### Audio Generation Fails
```bash
# Check internet connection
ping google.com

# Try different language
# Change lang='en' to lang='es' in the code

# Clear cache
streamlit cache clear
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Reinstall packages
pip uninstall streamlit gtts requests
pip install streamlit gtts requests
```
